# Multi-Threaded-Server
A simple Multi Threaded Chat room using Python


The project consists of 2 files namely clientstar.py and serverstar.py

Client file , when initiated , connects to the server using a separate thread. This holds true for multiple clients.

We have used the inbuilt libraries such as socket and threading to vreate the sockets and threads respectively

we haave also used the datetime module to print the system time in our chat server

We have several features in this chatroom such as members and admins where the admins have several functions such as to Ban, Kick , Unban members.

The admin functions are protected by a password .
